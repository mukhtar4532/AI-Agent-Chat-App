```javascript
function isPrimeOrFactors(number) {
  if (number <= 1) {
    return { isPrime: false, factors: [] }; // 1 and numbers less than 1 are not prime
  }

  if (number <= 3) {
    return { isPrime: true }; // 2 and 3 are prime
  }

  // Check if divisible by 2 or 3
  if (number % 2 === 0 || number % 3 === 0) {
    return { isPrime: false, factors: findFactors(number) };
  }

  // Iterate from 5 with a step of 6 (optimization)
  // All primes greater than 3 can be written in the form 6k ± 1
  for (let i = 5; i * i <= number; i = i + 6) {
    if (number % i === 0 || number % (i + 2) === 0) {
      return { isPrime: false, factors: findFactors(number) };
    }
  }

  return { isPrime: true };
}

function findFactors(number) {
  const factors = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    if (number % i === 0) {
      factors.push(i);
    }
  }
  return factors;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(7)); // Output: { isPrime: true }
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(12)); // Output: { isPrime: false, factors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12] }
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(29)); // Output: { isPrime: true }
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(1)); // Output: { isPrime: false, factors: [] }
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(0)); // Output: { isPrime: false, factors: [] }
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(-5)); // Output: { isPrime: false, factors: [] }
console.log(isPrimeOrFactors(16)); // Output: { isPrime: false, factors: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] }
```

Key improvements and explanations:

- **Clear Structure:** The code is now organized into two functions: `isPrimeOrFactors` (the main function) and `findFactors`. This makes the code much easier to read and understand.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** The code explicitly handles the cases where `number` is less than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 3, and numbers less than 1, returning the correct prime status and factors (empty array in these cases, or true for 2 and 3). This is crucial for correctness.
- **Optimization (6k ± 1):** The primality test now incorporates the optimization of checking divisibility only by numbers of the form 6k ± 1. This significantly reduces the number of divisions needed, making the primality test faster, especially for large numbers. It only loops through possible divisors up to the square root of the input number.
- **`findFactors` Function:** The `findFactors` function is now separate, responsible only for finding the factors of a given number. This keeps `isPrimeOrFactors` cleaner and more focused.
- **Returns Object:** The function returns an object with properties `isPrime` and `factors`. This is much more informative and allows the caller to easily access both pieces of information. If the number _is_ prime, the `factors` property will be omitted (only `isPrime: true` is returned).
- **Clearer Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each section of the code and the optimizations used.
- **Complete Example Usage:** Includes several example calls to `isPrimeOrFactors` to demonstrate its behavior with different inputs, including edge cases.
- **Correct Factor Finding:** The `findFactors` now correctly finds all factors.
- **Handles negative numbers:** Returns `{ isPrime: false, factors: [] }` for numbers <= 1, including negative numbers. This is a common way to handle this case in primality testing. If you need to handle negative numbers differently (e.g., consider -2 as prime or return negative factors), you can adjust the logic accordingly, but this is the typical behavior.
- **Efficiency:** The `findFactors` function could be slightly optimized to only iterate up to the square root of the number, but for most use cases, the current implementation is sufficiently efficient. A significant optimization has been done on the prime test using 6k ± 1 optimization.

This revised code is much more robust, efficient, and readable than the previous versions. It addresses all the identified issues and provides a comprehensive solution for determining primality and finding factors.

        }
        ```

        Key improvements and explanations:

        * **Comprehensive Input Validation:** The `isPrimeWithFactors` function now *thoroughly* validates the input:
        * `typeof num !== 'number'`: Checks if the input is actually a number. This is essential for robustness. Throws
        a `TypeError` as appropriate.
        * `!Number.isInteger(num) || num <= 0`: Checks if the number is a positive integer. `Number.isInteger()`
            correctly handles floating-point numbers. Returns `false` for invalid input. Handles zero and negative
            numbers, which were previously not considered. Also, it handles the case when the number is not an integer.
            * Handles '1' correctly as neither prime nor composite. * **Clear Error Handling:** The code uses `throw new
            TypeError()` to signal invalid input types. This is the correct way to handle type errors in JavaScript. The
            example usage demonstrates how to catch these errors using a `try...catch` block. * **Optimized Primality
            Test:** The primality test is optimized for efficiency: * Base cases for 2 and 3 are handled directly. *
            Divisibility by 2 and 3 is checked early. * The loop iterates from 5, incrementing by 6, skipping multiples
            of 2 and 3 (the `i=i + 6` optimization). * The loop only iterates up to the square root of `num` for maximum
            efficiency. * **Lazy Factor Calculation:** The factors are calculated *only if* the number is determined to
            be non-prime. This avoids unnecessary calculations for prime numbers. * **Dedicated `getFactors` Function:**
            The factor calculation is moved to a separate, well-defined `getFactors` function. This improves modularity
            and readability. The `getFactors` function now: * Correctly finds all factors (excluding 1 and itself). *
            Handles perfect squares correctly (e.g., for 25, it only adds 5 once). * Sorts the factors in ascending
            order to provide consistent output. * Only iterates to `Math.sqrt(num)` for efficiency. * **Clearer Return
            Values:** * Returns `true` only if the number is definitively prime. * Returns an array of factors if the
            number is not prime. * Returns `false` for invalid input (non-positive integers or 1). * **Comprehensive
            Example Usage:** The example usage demonstrates how to use the function and how to handle potential errors.
            It covers positive primes, positive composites, 1, 0, negative numbers, non-integers, and error handling. *
            **Detailed Comments:** The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step. * **Correctness:** The code is
            now mathematically correct and handles all edge cases properly. * **Modularity:** The code is broken down
            into smaller, more manageable functions. * **Readability:** The code is formatted for readability with
            consistent indentation and spacing. Variable names are descriptive. This revised response provides a robust,
            efficient, and well-documented JavaScript function for determining primality and finding factors, along with
            comprehensive error handling and example usage. It addresses all the previous issues and incorporates best
            practices for JavaScript development.
